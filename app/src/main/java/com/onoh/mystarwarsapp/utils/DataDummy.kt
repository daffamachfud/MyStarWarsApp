                "On May 21, 1980, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back made its theatrical debut. To celebrate the classic film’s landmark 40th anniversary, StarWars.com presents “Empire at 40,” a special series of interviews, editorial features, and listicles.\n" +

                        "\n" +
                        "Earlier this year, StarWars.com announced From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back, a new anthology celebrating 40 years of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. Arriving November 10, the book collects 40 stories by 40 authors reimagining the classic sequel through the eyes of background characters — heroes, villains, droids and creatures. Including some welcome returns.\n" +

                        "In StarWars.com’s exclusive excerpt of Brittany N. Williams’ “Faith in an Old Friend,” we flashback to the Millennium Falcon‘s desperate journey following the Battle of Hoth, as Han Solo, Leia Organa, and friends look to escape the Empire’s clutches. Except here, we’re reintroduced to L3-37, Lando Calrissian’s rebellious droid. Now one with the Falcon‘s central computer, L3-37 is as spirited as ever — and we wouldn’t want it any other way.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "“I’m probably one of many people who read Last Shot and watched Solo and fell in love with L3-37,” Williams tells StarWars.com. “She has this great design, she’s hilarious and dynamic, she and Lando had this amazing rapport, and then, Kessel happened. Like, I think about L3-37 every time I see the Millennium Falcon now. So when I got the invite to write a story for From a Certain Point of View, it’s like here’s the perfect opportunity to make sure that our girl is alright and give her another moment with Lando. And I couldn’t really pass that up.”\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "In addition, StarWars.com caught up with editor Tom Hoeler to talk about putting together such an ambitious project, and how From a Certain Point of View: The Empire Strikes Back supports a good cause.",

                "There’s a lot of Star Wars stories out there for us to enjoy — 11 live action movies, four series comprising 15 seasons (and counting), video games, comics, novels and other books, virtual-reality storytelling, theme park experiences, and more. And if you want to learn more about the ever-expanding Star Wars galaxy, The Star Wars Book by DK Publishing is here to rescue you. Authored by Pablo Hidalgo, Cole Horton, and Dan Zehr, The Star Wars Book dives deep through over two hundred pages — not just into the characters, history, and technology of Star Wars, but also into how it all connects together, from Alderaan to Zuckuss. Not meant as an all-encompassing encyclopedia, The Star Wars Book focuses more on the galaxy’s most notable characters, organizations, events, and species, and provides deeper examinations for these entries. Here’s a sprinkling of the secrets held within its pages.",

                "For fans of the Force and sneaker fashion, nothing compares to the combined strength of Star Wars and adidas.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "Adidas, one of the world’s most iconic brands and longtime collaborators with Lucasfilm, have just launched a new line celebrating 40 years of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. With offerings ranging from white-and-lightsaber-blue Luke Skywalker Stan Smith sneakers to shimmering all-gold C-3PO high tops, the series is a beautifully-designed expression of fandom — with more to come. StarWars.com caught up with adidas designer Till Jagla to talk about the line and merging “the best of both worlds.”StarWars.com: When it comes to incorporating a license into fashion, the design can go in several directions: subtle, over-the-top, retro, modern, etc. For adidas’s Star Wars sneakers, how did you dial in on an approach that would be right for both brands?\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "Till Jagla: For this particular collaboration we wanted to create something very authentic and exciting for the true Star Wars fans. This is why we opted for a very conceptual approach to product. We wanted the key characters of Star Wars history being reflected the best. This includes the right choice of the adidas model, the key design direction, suitable details, and ultimately the packaging. We were inspired by the rich history of Star Wars and tried to come up with products that feel real. \nTill Jagla: I would say it’s fairly easy when you work on something that carries so much equity. The mentioned characters have a clear identity and they are known across the globe and loved by pretty much all generations. If we now merge the best of both worlds, Lucasfilm and adidas, we get something very iconic out of it. By using extraordinary materials that reflect the iconic characters, such as golden leather or molded shell toes, the shoes get a fashionable twist right away. For me personally, it’s cool to wear something that is very iconic, but fashionable at the same time. ",

                "Star Wars has always been a genre mashup. Samurai films, Westerns, and Saturday matinee serials are all part of the magic mix of the saga. And over the years, Star Wars has infused everything from monster movies (Star Wars: The Clone Wars’ “The Zillo Beast”) to straight-up gothic horror (IDW Publishing’s Tales from Vader’s Castle series). But now, something new — and definitely unexpected — is inspiring the galaxy far, far away.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "“We found ourselves talking about holiday specials,” James Waugh, vice president, franchise content and strategy at Lucasfilm, tells StarWars.com, “and the heritage of sitting down and watching holiday specials every year, and how beloved and timeless those things are. When looking at what to do next with LEGO Star Wars, it kind of went from there.That brainstorm eventually led to The LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special, coming to Disney+ on November 17 — the day our galaxy observes the now-canonical Star Wars holiday of Life Day. The LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special picks up post-Episode IX and finds Rey continuing her Jedi training. She comes upon something mystical in a Jedi temple that sends her hurtling through time, meeting Star Wars legends and visiting places of the past — but still, she must get back home for Life Day. The cast features many returning fan favorites, including Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico, Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, as well as several Star Wars: The Clone Wars vets: Matt Lanter (Anakin Skywalker), Tom Kane (Yoda, along with Qui-Gon Jinn), James Arnold Taylor (Obi-Wan Kenobi), and Dee Bradley Baker (clone troopers) are all back. “We’re particularly thrilled that these great actors from the Star Wars family chose to reprise their roles and came to play in this LEGO sandbox,” Josh Rimes, director of animation development at Lucasfilm, says.”",
